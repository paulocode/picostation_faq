## When release?
When it's done

## Compatible PSX models?
Same with xStation: PU-8 and PU-18.

## Does it need soldering?
Yes, and pin lifting. https://gamingdoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/xStation_Installation_Guide_english_PU18.pdf

## Can we keep the real CD laser?
Not currently. It's maybe possible but requires soldering to the raised pins and a switchboard.

## Do I need an xStation QSB?
Preferably yes, but you can also use an FPC/FFC adapter: https://twitter.com/paulo7x8/status/1602026685360377856

## What resources did you use to develop picostation?
1. CXD2545Q datasheet
2. [VBKesha's posts on an FPGA-based ODE](https://habr.com/en/post/666296/)
3. Logic analyzer of a PS1 with a real CD
4. xStation pinouts: https://github.com/x-station/xstation-issues/issues/52 https://github.com/x-station/xstation-issues
5. Help from PSXDev team

## Can you do the same on PS2/Saturn/Dreamcast?
No, sorry.
